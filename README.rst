CUDA Examples
=============

This repo contains code examples and explanations on how to accelerate some code
using CUDA. The repo was prepared for a talk I gave to the Signal Processing
Group in July 2018.

There are many CUDA examples on the internet, these examples are not too
different, just framed from the point of view that may help the SigProc group
the most. In particular - calling fast but perhaps strange code from python.

This is based off `this blog`__, which gives a great introduction to CUDA's
thread and memory management.
